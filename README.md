## cheatsheet
A cheatsheet for Machine Learning and python is stored. This is the knowledge of how I have preprocessed data especially for Kaggle.

As there are too many things to learn and digest, [this map](https://github.com/suzukiry/mylab/blob/master/misc/figures/ml.xml) might be helpful for a machine learning starter like me. Please open via [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

## ipython
General codes for jupyter notebook users are stored. Not to mention, very basic one since I'm always a learner.


## kaggle
Code records for Kaggle competition are stored.


# paiza
